# Realtime_ObjectDetection
A Real-Time Object Detection uses AI model by Kotlin program.

To run the app, you need use android version 11+.

In the app, I already run the app on Samsung galaxy A21s. To pair Android Studio with the phone:

1. In the phone: Settings -> About phone -> Software information -> Tap 4 or 5 time for Build number -> Settings -> Developer Options -> Tap USB debugging -> Wireless debugging -> In the Wireless debugging, choosing pair type (QR scanning or code).
2. After finishing pairing, you will see the phone name in Android studio, and you can start running the application.
